# Values in this file are used to render the code template during testing. 

# If you run pytest (see README.md), it will automatically discover this file and
# `code-template.py.jinja`, render the code template for all parameter combinations 
# in here and check that the code runs without errors. 

# For each user input, you can specify a single value (e.g. key: value) or a few different 
# values (e.g. below) that should be tested.
